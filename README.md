GeeseHacks 2025 Project: https://geese-claims.web.app/

## Inspiration 
GeeseClaims was inspired by the recent LA wildfires and the struggles experienced by younger affected individuals who were making their first insurance claim. The goal of GeeseClaims is to take away the stress of making an insurance claim by guiding the user through the entire process from start to finish.

## What it does 
GeeseClaims guides the user through the process of making an insurance claim, adding prompts and reminders to help them make a direct claim to their insurer through our site.

## How we built it
The website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the frontend and deployed to Google Firebase.

## What's next for GeeseClaims
Our roadmap for GeeseClaims focuses on expanding our utility and building partnerships with insurance companies. This includes but is not limited to:
- Develop the MVP.
- Conduct user testing across different demographics.
- Integrate AI for automated item recognition and verification.
- Focus on refining accessibility features.
- Form partnerships with Insurance Companies
Work on improving app security
